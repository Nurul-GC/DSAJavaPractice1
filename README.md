| # | DS ALGORITHM | EXAMPLE CASE | PROBLEM STATEMENTS |
|-|-|-|-|
| A. | 1. | **Binary Search** | Find the index of the target integer | Given a sorted array of integers and an integer called target, find the element that equals the target and return its index. |
|    | 2. || Find the boolean boundary from a sorted boolean array | Find integer's index | An array of boolean values is divided into two sections: the left section consists of all false, and the right section consists of all true. Find the boundary of the right section, i.e. the index of the first true element. If there is no true element, return -1. |
|    | 3. || Find the index of element not smaller than the target int. | Given an array of integers sorted in increasing order and a target, find the index of the first element in the array that is larger or equal to the target. Assume that it is guaranteed to find a satisfying number. |
|    | 4. || Find first occurrence of a target from an int array | Given a sorted array of integers and a target integer, find the first occurrence of the target and return its index. Return *-1* if the target is not in the array. |
|    | 5. || Find the square root using binary search | Given an integer, find its square root without using the built-in square root function. Only return the integer part (truncate the decimals). |
|    | 6. || Find minimum in rotated sorted array | A sorted array was rotated at an unknown pivot. For example, * [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] * becomes * [30, 40, 50, 10, 20] *. Find the index of the minimum element in this array.
