| # | DS ALGORITHM | EXAMPLE CASE | PROBLEM STATEMENTS |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1. | **Binary Search** | Find the index of the target integer | Given a sorted array of integers and an integer called target, find the element that equals the target and return its index. |
| 2. || Find the boolean boundary | Find integer's index | An array of boolean values is divided into two sections: the left section consists of all false, and the right section consists of all true. Find the boundary of the right section, i.e. the index of the first true element. If there is no true element, return -1. |
| 3. || Find element not smaller than target. | Given an array of integers sorted in increasing order and a target, find the index of the first element in the array that is larger or equal to the target. Assume that it is guaranteed to find a satisfying number. |
